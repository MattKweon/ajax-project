# cocktail-card-deck

A dynamic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript solo project.

## Brief description of project

the ones they like to a card deck.

### Why I built this
As a cocktail enthusiat myself, I wanted to create an app that could save my favorite
cocktail recipes with a visually apealling and clean UI. I utilized this project as
an opportunity to test the front end programming skills that I've accumulated over a
6 week period. This was also a great project to gain some experience implementing a
public API and making asynchronous calls to retrieve data for my app.
